I am Chengkun, currently a PhD student at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/machine-and-human-intelligence), supervised by [Luigi Acerbi](https://lacerbi.github.io/). My research focuses on Bayesian posterior computation, namely, 
$$p(\text{parameters})p(\text{data}|\text{parameters}) \rightarrow p(\text{parameters}|\text{data}),$$ 
exploring an alternative path other than direct MCMC sampling and variational inference. I used to work on computer vision and robotics too.

# About the site

This website is a personal initiative to encourage more writing, both as a tool for memory retention and to deepen my understanding of reality. As Richard Feynman once said:

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.
