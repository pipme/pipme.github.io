So I decide to start blogging with Quarto and probably make slides with it in the future as the web-based solution (revealjs) looks elegant and promising in the long run.\n\nBuilding a site with Quarto is relatively easy and interesting. The documentation is very nicely written. You could find some useful tips [here](../2023-06-11-Quarto-tips/index-gist.qmd). See @navarro2022 for more workthrough details.  \n\nBy the way, I fell in love with writing in markdown since the birth of another great tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and gradually realize that habitual writing is essential for a researcher, for building one's second brain, undertanding things better and sharing knowledge.\n\nFor Obsidian, I put some useful plugins [here](../2023-06-11-Obsidian-Zotero-tips/), together with Zotero's. Maybe I could write a blog for sharing my workflows in an academic life. I will probably wait until I get more familiar with Quarto and see how they fit with daily needs.\n\nWelcome to my blog ðŸ˜ƒ &#10003; :grinning:!\nHere is some plain text.\n\nNext, let's write some pseudo code.  Note that you don't _have_ to specify a language if using plain backticks.\n\n```\nobject <- [some kind of calculation]\n```\n\nIf you set `eval = FALSE` you can get the highlighted background\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobject <- [some kind of calculation]\nNote that this; is not valid R code\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it interesting that your example works just fine for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloop through each species\n    loop through each measurement of the current species\n    ...\netc.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Algorithm 1\nJust a sample algorithmn\n\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\DontPrintSemicolon\n\\SetAlgoLined\n\\KwResult{Write here the result}\n\\SetKwInOut{Input}{Input}\\SetKwInOut{Output}{Output}\n\\Input{Write here the input}\n\\Output{Write here the output}\n\\BlankLine\n\\While{While condition}{\n    instructions\\;\n    \\eIf{condition}{\n        instructions1\\;\n        instructions2\\;\n    }{\n        instructions3\\;\n    }\n}\n\\caption{While loop with If/Else condition}\n\\end{algorithm} ",
