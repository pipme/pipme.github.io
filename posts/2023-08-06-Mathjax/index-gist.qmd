As a MathJax and javascript noob, it seems the most convenient way to define MathJax macros is to write a [preamble file](https://github.com/pipme/pipme.github.io/_utils/mathjax_preamble.html) and include it by:
```yaml
format:
  html:
    include-before-body: ../_utils/mathjax_preamble.html
```

Example: 
$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div (\rho \u) = 0
$$
