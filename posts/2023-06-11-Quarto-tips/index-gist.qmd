Unicode `\u200B` for zero width space, e.g., in `_quarto.yml` I used it for an item in the navigation bar with icon only. Note that I tried HTML's `&#8203;` but it doesn't work.

Extensions for adding icons such as google scholar {{< ai google-scholar >}} and 500px {{< fa brands 500px >}} (see the website's footer):
```bash
.
├── quarto-ext
│   └── fontawesome
└── schochastics
    └── academicons
```
